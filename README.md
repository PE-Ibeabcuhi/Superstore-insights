## About the Project
This project carries out an exploratory data analysis on a superstore dataset.
In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset that contains sales and customer data from a large supermarket chain. 
Our goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and sales trends, in order to help the supermarket improve its operations and better serve its customers.
We will be using data analysis techniques like descriptive statistics and data visualization to understand the data and identify patterns and trends.
